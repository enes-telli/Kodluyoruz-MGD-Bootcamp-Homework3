Kodluyoruz Mobile Game Development Bootcamp 3rd Homework.
<br>A simple game that contains checkpoints. The game contains 3 scenes. Main Scene, Game Scene and Winning Scene. The game starts with the Main Scene. After the player clicks the play button, the Game Scene opens and the game starts. The player can move with the WASD keys or the arrow keys and jump with the space key. The player's goal is to pass the checkpoints in order. The order is from dark to light color. In this case the main color is blue. When the game starts, the position of the checkpoints is randomly assigned. There are 25 possible positions in total where they can be. If the player passes through the correct checkpoint, the color of the checkpoint will be permanently green. If the player passes through the wrong checkpoint, the color of the checkpoint will be red for a short time and returns to its original color. If the player passes the final checkpoint, the game ends and the Winning Scene opens.</br>
